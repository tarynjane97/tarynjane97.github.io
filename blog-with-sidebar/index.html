                <p>
                    “I’ve been preparing for this for years, and it’s not 
                    nearly as exciting as I thought it would be.” Underneath 
                    our teammate’s words were a load of disappointment that had 
                    come as her first month overseas felt a lot more like 
                    drudgery than heroism. The day-to-day grind of life on the 
                    mission field seemed like a far cry from inspiring stories 
                    she had heard from missionaries who had claimed massive 
                    movements of God among the nations. Too often, missionaries 
                    and those stirring up others to pour out their lives among 
                    the unreached inadvertently paint a monochromatic picture 
                    of an exciting move of God among the nations of the earth. 
                    They tell aspiring missionaries, “There is no better way to 
                    spend your life than among the nations,” and “Don’t you 
                    want to see people like the Uyghurs in China have a chance 
                    to hear the gospel before they die?”
                </p>
                <h2>When The Excitement Of The Mission Fades</h2>
                <p>
                    Those mobilizing pour gasoline on this zeal for mission 
                    with short-term trips, in-depth Bible studies, and 
                    triumphant missionary biographies. By the time the young 
                    missionary arrives on the field, she believes that she is 
                    stepping into the only thing that God is doing. She 
                    believes the inevitable excitement she feels will translate 
                    to a parade of divine appointments and days full of 
                    significance. Just like the gasoline, she burns hot—for a 
                    little while. Then the language study hits. The new 
                    missionary finds that he can’t communicate as clearly as a 
                    toddler. Then the culture shock comes. Why do these people 
                    do that in that way? Does no one here have any common 
                    sense? The first rounds of sickness follow. New viruses and 
                    bacteria ravage family members’ bodies. Sleepless nights, 
                    inadvertently-offended neighbors, and complete 
                    powerlessness to do much for themselves can discourage and 
                    demotivate new missionaries quickly. Is there a better 
                    strategy to mobilize, prepare, and train missionaries for 
                    the realities of life overseas?
                </p>
                <h2>The Biblical Model: A Vocation of Suffering</h2>
                <p>
                    When God assigned the apostle Paul to his mission to the 
                    nations, the Holy Spirit told Ananias, “Go, for he is a 
                    chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the 
                    Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel.” Now that’s 
                    motivational and inspiring, but the Spirit did not stop 
                    here. He goes on to say, “For I will show him how much he 
                    must suffer for the sake of my name” (Acts 9:15–16). When 
                    Jesus sent the seventy-two out on the first recorded 
                    short-term mission trip in history, he told them to expect 
                    to be sheep among wolves and face betrayal, flogging, and 
                    legal accusations (Matthew 10:5–25). It appears that God 
                    has a more balanced mobilization approach than we often do. 
                    He promises that missionaries will experience 
                    both fruitfulness and suffering.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    "God promises that missionaries will experience both 
                    fruitfulness and suffering."
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Scripture implies that Paul learned his mobilization 
                    methods directly from Christ. In 2 Timothy 1:8, when Paul 
                    is speaking to his son in the faith, he says, “share in 
                    suffering for the gospel by the power of God.” He repeats 
                    this same call and encouragement three more times in 2 
                    Timothy (2:3, 2:9, 4:5). Paul knew this suffering 
                    firsthand, as he often recounted in his letters.
                </p>
                <h2>The Call to Suffer</h2>
                <p>
                    In a recent article, Ryan Martin argues that the call to 
                    missions is a call to suffer. But why is suffering a good 
                    thing for those who through the leadership of the Spirit 
                    and the affirmation of their churches go to the nations? 
                    John Piper has argued, based on Colossians 1, that it is 
                    through their sufferings, not just their words, 
                    missionaries deliver the gospel to the nations. Everyone to 
                    whom missionaries minister lives in a broken world. 
                    Missionaries must learn to hold out hope in the midst of 
                    suffering, to shine as lights in the world who are not 
                    marked by grumbling or complaining (Philippians 2:14–15). 
                    As they share in Christ’s suffering, they display the 
                    beauty of hope to the world, and they have an opportunity 
                    to give a reason for the hope that they have 
                    (1 Peter 3:8–22). Their hope in heavenly reward for earthly 
                    suffering both flows from and empowers the gospel they 
                    share (2 Corinthians 4:13–18).
                </p>
                <h2>Experiencing Suffering as a Family</h2>
                <p>
                    For my own family, suffering has come in many forms. We’ve 
                    faced teammates with mental health crises that caused them 
                    to leave the field. We’ve seen national friends suffer 
                    intense persecution. Both we and our kids have fought 
                    months of sickness and emotional trauma. We’ve moved five 
                    times in our life overseas, and two of those were not by 
                    our choice. One of our parents suffered and died from a 
                    horrible, debilitating disease in a few months’ time. Pile 
                    on culture shock, our own sin, team conflict, loneliness, 
                    isolation, and the daily pressure of the churches, and the 
                    weight of suffering feels crushing many days. Most of that 
                    hardship has not been relieved by mighty moves of God in 
                    the places we’ve served. Often, God’s work has been just 
                    like Jesus described it: slow like a seed growing, 
                    imperceptible like the wind blowing, and gradual like 
                    leaven causing the bread to rise. The job has rarely been 
                    glamorous, but God has always been good. How can we change 
                    the culture of mobilization to be more biblical? Churches, 
                    sending organizations, and missionary candidates must take 
                    steps to look more carefully at suffering in the task.
                </p>
                <h2>Promoting a Biblical Vision</h2>
                <p>
                    Churches, and those training missionaries, need to seek 
                    those who have suffered well and display the perseverance, 
                    character, and hope that only comes through hardship and a 
                    godly response to it. Far too often, churches are 
                    encouraged to send their best, which usually translates to 
                    those with the most gifts, greatest ministry potential, or 
                    highest demonstrated fruitfulness.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    "Please send missionaries with great gifts, but make sure 
                    they have great perseverance and godly character as well."
                </h3>
                <p>
                    What if, instead, they sent their most scarred, those who 
                    have suffered well, but emerged still ministering out of 
                    their brokenness and walking in faith? What if senders 
                    began to see suffering as an essential part of the 
                    reparation process? Consider Hudson Taylor, who before he 
                    left for China spent months living in intentional hardship 
                    and sacrifice, seeking to train himself to survive on less. 
                    Please send missionaries with great gifts, but make sure 
                    they have great perseverance and godly character as well. 
                    The temptation is to end with stories of triumph and 
                    transformation, but we aren’t promised great stories from
                    the field. We are promised that some will plant, some will 
                    water, but that God alone causes the growth 
                    (1 Corinthians 3:6). This growth might not happen in 
                    our lifetimes.
                </p>
                <h3>"The temptation is to end with stories of triumph and 
                    transformation, but we aren’t promised great stories 
                    from the field.""
                </h3>
                <p>Certainly, we want to see healthy churches among unreached 
                    peoples and places, but we aren’t promised to see that with 
                    our own eyes, and we certainly aren’t promised to see that 
                    without hardship and trials. We aren’t called to be 
                    superstars. We are called to be sufferers.
