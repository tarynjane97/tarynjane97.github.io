                        Hope is an optimistic state of mind that is based on an 
                        expectation of positive outcomes with respect to events and 
                        circumstances in one’s life or the world at large.[1] As a 
                        verb, its definitions include: “expect with confidence” and 
                        “to cherish a desire with anticipation”.[2]                    
                        Among its opposites are dejection, hopelessness, 
                        and despair.[3]

                    <p>
                        Professor of Psychology Barbara Fredrickson argues that hope
                        comes into its own when crisis looms, opening us to new 
                        creative possibilities.[4] Frederickson argues that with 
                        great need comes an unusually wide range of ideas, as well 
                        as such positive emotions as happiness and joy, courage, 
                        and empowerment, drawn from four different areas of one’s 
                        self: from a cognitive, psychological, social, or physical 
                        perspective.[5] Hopeful people are “like the little engine 
                        that could, [because] they keep telling themselves “I think
                        I can, I think I can”.[6] Such positive thinking bears 
                        fruit when based on a realistic sense of optimism, not on 
                        a naive “false hope”.[7][8] The psychologist Charles R. 
                        Snyder linked hope to the existence of a goal, combined 
                        with a determined plan for reaching that goal.[9] Alfred 
                        Adler had similarly argued for the centrality of 
                        goal-seeking in human psychology,[10] as too had 
                        philosophical anthropologists like Ernst Bloch.[11] 
                        Snyder also stressed the link between hope and mental 
                        willpower (hardiness),[12] as well as the need for 
                        realistic perception of goals (problem orientation),[13] 
                        arguing that the difference between hope and optimism was
                        that the former can look like wishful thinking but the 
                        latter provides the energy to find practical pathways for 
                        an improved future.[14] D. W. Winnicott saw a child’s 
                        antisocial behavior as expressing as a cry for help, an 
                        unconscious hope, meaning an unspoken desire for a 
                        positive outcome for those who are in control in the 
                        wider society, when containment within the immediate 
                        family had failed.[15] Object relations theory similarly 
                        sees the analytic transference as motivated in part by an 
                        unconscious hope that past conflicts and traumas can be 
                        dealt with anew.[16]

                    <h3 id="hope-theory">Hope Theory</h3>
                    <p>As a specialist in positive psychology, Snyder studied how 
                        hope and forgiveness can impact several aspects of life such
                        as health, work, education, and personal meaning. He 
                        postulated that there are three main things that make up 
                        hopeful thinking:[17]
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Goals – Approaching life in a goal-oriented way.</li>
                        <li>
                            Pathways – Finding different ways to achieve your goals
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Agency – Believing that you can instigate change and 
                            achieve these goals.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        In other words, hope was defined as the perceived capability
                        to derive pathways to desired goals and motivate oneself 
                        via agency thinking to use those pathways.
                        Snyder argues that individuals who are able to realize these
                        three components and develop a belief in their ability are 
                        hopeful people who can establish clear goals, imagine 
                        multiple workable pathways toward those goals, and 
                        persevere, even when obstacles get in their way.

                    <h3 id="major-theories">Major Theories</h3>
                    <p>
                        Of the countless models that examine the importance of hope 
                        in an individual’s life, two major theories have gained a 
                        significant amount of recognition in the field of 
                        psychology. One of these theories, developed by Charles R. 
                        Snyder, argues that hope should be viewed as a cognitive 
                        skill that demonstrates an individual’s ability to maintain 
                        drive in the pursuit of a particular goal.[24] This model 
                        reasons that an individual’s ability to be hopeful depends 
                        on two types of thinking: agency thinking and pathway 
                        thinking. Agency thinking refers to an individual’s 
                        determination to achieve their goals despite possible 
                        obstacles, while pathway thinking refers to the ways in 
                        which an individual believes they can achieve these 
                        personal goals. Snyder’s theory uses hope as a mechanism 
                        that is most often seen in psychotherapy. In these 
                        instances, the therapist helps their client overcome 
                        barriers that have prevented them from achieving goals. The 
                        therapist would then help the client set realistic and 
                        relevant personal goals (i.e. “I am going to find something 
                        I am passionate about and that makes me feel good about 
                        myself”), and would help them remain hopeful of their 
                        ability to achieve these goals, and suggest the correct 
                        pathways to do so.

                    <p>
                        Hope is a key concept in most major world religions, often 
                        signifying the “hoper” believes an individual or a 
                        collective group will reach a concept of heaven. Depending 
                        on the religion, hope can be seen as a prerequisite for 
                        and/or byproduct of spiritual attainment
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="christianity">Christianity</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hope is one of the three theological virtues of the 
                        Christian religion,[51] alongside faith and love.[52] “Hope”
                        in the Holy Bible means “a strong and confident 
                        expectation” of future reward (see Titus 1:2). In modern 
                        terms, hope is akin to trust and a confident 
                        expectation”.[53] Paul the Apostle argued that Christ was 
                        a source of hope for Christians: “For in this hope we have 
                        been saved”[53] (see Romans 8:24). According to the Holman 
                        Bible Dictionary, hope is a “[t]rustful expectation…the 
                        anticipation of a favorable outcome under God’s 
                        guidance.”[54] In The Pilgrim’s Progress, it is Hopeful who
                        comforts Christian in Doubting Castle; while conversely 
                        at the entrance to Dante’s Hell were the words, “Lay down 
                        all hope, you that go in by me”.[55]
