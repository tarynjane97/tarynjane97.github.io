            <b>Graphic design</b>
            is a 
            <a href="#">profession</a>,
            <sup>[2]</sup> 
            <a href="#">academic discipline</a>
            <sup>[3][4][5]</sup> 
            and 
            <a href="#">applied art</a> 
            whose activity consists in projecting 
            <a href="#">visual communications</a>
            intended to transmit specific messages to social 
            groups, with specific objectives.
            <sup>[6]</sup> 
            Graphic design is an interdisciplinary branch of 
            <a href="#">design</a>
            <sup>[1]</sup> 
            and of the 
            <a href="#">fine arts</a>. 
            Its practice involves 
            <a href="#">creativity</a>, 
            <a href="#">innovation</a> 
            and 
            <a href="#">lateral thinking</a> 
            using manual or 
            <a href="#">digital tools</a>, 
            where it is usual to use text and graphics to communicate visually.

        <p>
            <a href="#">William Addison Dwiggins</a> 
            is often credited with first using the 
            term "graphic design" in a 1922 article,
            <sup>[14]</sup> 
            although it appears in a 4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of 
            Organized Labor, a publication of the Labor Unions of San Francisco
            , in an article about technical education for printers:

        <h2 id="history">History</h2>
        <p>
            In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent 
            explosion of 
            <a href="#">visual communication</a> 
            in the 20th and 21st centuries, the 
            distinction between advertising, art, graphic design and fine art 
            has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, 
            practices, 
            <a href="#">languages</a> 
            and sometimes the same benefactor or client. 
            In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and 
            services. In graphic design, "the essence is to give order to 
            information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts 
            that document the human experience."

            In the 1920s, Soviet constructivism applied 'intellectual 
            production' in different spheres of production. The movement saw 
            individualistic art as useless in revolutionary Russia and thus 
            moved towards creating objects for utilitarian purposes.

        <h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
        <p>
            Graphic design can have many applications, from 
            <a href="#">road signs</a> 
            to technical schematics and reference 
            <a href="#">manuals</a>. 
            It is often used in branding products and elements of company 
            identity such as logos, colors, 
            <a hreef="#">packaging</a>, 
            <a href="#">labelling</a> 
            and text.

            A graphic design project may involve the creative presentation of 
            existing 
            <a href="#">text</a>, 
            ornament, and images.

            The "process school" is concerned with communication; it highlights 
            the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and 
            by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. 
            The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs 
            which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; 
            communication as an agent.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
